# Plugin manager plugin

These will use global commands to /enable and /disable plugins.

All commands will be guild level commands. Since there is a limit to how many commands a guild can have, we have to be as conservative as possible.

The best goal I can think of is 30 commands with multiple sub commands across all plugins, with 20 spare for custom commands that users can create.
