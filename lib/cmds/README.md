# Commands v2

Commands will be done via slash commands. We need support for sub commands too, so the API will have to get some sort of facelift to make this
intuitive. We'll also have to see how this effects plugins, but lets just hope that we can register a command that actually represents a tree
of interaction handlers and command metadata.
