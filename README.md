# Koppa

Koppa's your all-purpose Discord multi-tool ðŸ› 

*Reinventing the wheel in order to create the round square.*

## Development

Some things you ought to know for development:
 - Koppa uses a principle of grouping things by their role in the business logic instead of by technical roles
   e.g. using plugins instead of a commands folder and events folder
 - Koppa uses plugins to ensure modularity and extensibility for users.
 - We try and separate complex logic and feature creation as much as possible by making most of the
   directly interacted with user features like plugins in the `src` directory and the libraries that
   power this in the `lib` directory. 
    - Consider the following as the best rule of thumb:
      - An experience that a user can interact with -> `src`
      - A tool, framework, or piece of logic that enables that -> `lib`

### Adding custom events

If you want to add a custom event to koppa for a plugin to emit or listen to,
go to `lib/core/events` and add the event as the key with its arguments object as its value.
Then in the map, use the event as key and the value an array of the object keys in order.
